## Class takeaways
Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:
- **Introduction to Unit Testing**, specifically:
  - Set up and tear down
  - Test Doubles
- **Unit Testing Best Practices and Anti-Patterns**
  - Best practices
    - Each test must verify only one behaviour
    - Test case selection should be comprehensive
    - Full regression testing should be run as often as possible
    - Code must be written so that it is testable (e.g., pure functions or methods)
  - Anti-patterns
    - Do never test private methods directly
    - Do never expose private state
    - Do not leak domain knowledge to the unit tests
    - Avoid code pollution

Check out the following code sample:
- Mocking - Customer onboarding: [Pytest/Python](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_customer_onboarding_mock) | [Jest/JavaScript](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_customer_onboarding_mock) | [PHPUnit/PHP8](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/php_customer_onboarding_mock)
