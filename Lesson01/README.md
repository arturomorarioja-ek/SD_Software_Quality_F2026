[Software Quality - Spring 2026](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Software_Quality_F2026/blob/main/README.md)

# Lesson 1 - 27 January

## Class takeaways
Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:
- **Introduction to Software Testing**, with special focus on the following concepts:
  - Testing vs. Debugging
  - Static vs. Dynamic Testing
  - Positive vs. Negative Testing
  - Verification and Validation
  - Regression Testing
  - The General Testing Principles
- **SDLCs and the V-model**, with special focus on:
  - The rationale of the V-model
  - How to apply it in the context of a software development project
  - How to apply it in an iterative development (e.g., Agile)
  - The differences between the four levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
  - The Test Pyramid, with a critical focus as to its present day validity 
- **Introduction to Unit Testing**, specifically:
  - The AAA pattern
  - Parameterised tests/data providers

## Homework
- Check out the following code samples:
  - Calculator Sum ([Python/Pyunit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_sum_unit_tests) | [JavaScript/Jest](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_sum_unit_tests) | [PHP/PHPUnit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/php_sum_unit_tests)). Very basic unit tests mostly following the AAA pattern
  - VAT Calculation ([Python/Pyunit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/python_vat) | [JavaScript/Jest](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_vat) | [PHP/PHPUnit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/php_vat_unit_tests)). Data provider/parameterised test examples. Jest's are a bit "playful"
  - Length Converter ([Python/Pyunit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/py_length_converter_unit_tests) | [JavaScript/Jest](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_length_converter_unit_tests) | [PHP/PHPUnit](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/php_length_converter_unit_tests)). Data providers and exception testing

- Research unit testing frameworks for your preferred programming language(s)

- Design and write unit tests for the following exercise using the programming language and unit testing framework of your choice. Use parameterised tests and try to elaborate a comprehensive list of test cases that bring value to the process:
