## Homework
- Check out the following slide decks in Itslearning:
  - **Test Design Techniques: White Box**, with a special focus on:
    - The value of coverage as a testing metric
    - The difference between statement and decision coverage
    - How to calculate coverage with different unit testing frameworks (slides on **Pytest**, **Jest**, **PHPUnit**) 
  - **Static Testing: Static Code Analysis**, specifically:
    - The value these tools bring to software quality
    - Linting, exemplified in JavaScript (check out the slides on **ESLint**)
  - **Test Design Techniques - Black-box**, with especial attention to:
    - Decision Table Testing
- Finish the remaining [coverage calculation exercises](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-ek/SD_Software_Quality_F2026/blob/main/Lesson04/01%20Coverage.md) (Number and Employees)
- Calculate coverage for your previous unit testing projects with your unit testing framework or library of choice
  - Evaluate whether the uncovered statements deserve a unit test or not
- Try a linter for the programming language of your choice
- Research static code analysis tools like SonarQube (generic) and also for your specific programming language
